# Using CNNs to model affect of histone modification on gene expression

WORK IN PROGRESS

Here I implement the CNN described in [DeepChrome: Deep-learning for predicting gene expression from histone modifications](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/17/i639/2450757) in tf.

I used toy data [another implementation](https://github.com/QData/DeepChrome) before training on the real dataset.
